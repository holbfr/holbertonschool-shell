Explain the differences between physical machines, virtual machines, and containers.
Describe the problems containers are designed to solve.
Install Docker and verify that the container runtime is functioning.
Pull images from a container registry and run basic containers.
Inspect containers and images to understand configuration, metadata, and runtime information.
Understand the purpose and structure of a Dockerfile.
Build custom images and reason about image layers.
Explain how Docker reuses or rebuilds layers during image builds.
Describe how containers move through different lifecycle states.
Distinguish between ephemeral container storage and persistent volumes.
Manage disk usage by removing unused Docker resources.
